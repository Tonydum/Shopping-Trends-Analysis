# Shopping Trends Analysis

## Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of shopping trends based on a dataset containing customer purchase details. The aim is to uncover insights into customer demographics, purchasing patterns, seasonal trends, spending habits, and the impact of discounts and promotions.

## Dataset

The dataset, shopping_trends.csv, includes several attributes such as customer age, gender, item category, purchase amount, location, season, and more.

## Objectives

Analyze customer demographics (age and gender distribution).
Investigate purchasing trends across different categories and seasons.
Examine geographical distribution of sales.
Study spending patterns among different customer groups.
Evaluate the effectiveness of discounts and promotional strategies.
Identify popular products and colors.

## Tools Used

Power BI: For data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.

## Key Findings

1. Customer Demographics:
Age Distribution: The average age of customers is 44 years, with a range from 18 to 70 years. This indicates a broad age range of our customer base.
Gender Distribution: Out of 3,900 customers, 2,652 are male (68%) and 1,248 are female (32%), showing a higher inclination of males in our customer demographics.

2. Purchasing Trends by Category:
Clothing (1,737 purchases) is the most popular category, followed by Accessories (1,240), Footwear (599), and Outerwear (324). This suggests a strong preference for clothing items among our customers.

3. Seasonal Trends:
Spring (999 purchases) and Fall (975 purchases) are the peak seasons for shopping, followed closely by Winter (971) and Summer (955). This indicates a fairly even distribution of purchases across seasons.

4. Geographical Trends:
The top locations for purchases are Montana (96), California (95), and Idaho (93). This highlights key geographical markets for our business.

5. Spending Patterns:
The average purchase amount is $59.76. There is a slight variation in spending by age, with the highest average spending by customers aged 53 ($67.89) and the lowest by those aged 48 ($52.59).
Gender-based analysis shows females spend on average $60.25, slightly higher than males at $59.54.

6. Discounts and Promo Codes:
Interestingly, the average purchase amount without a discount ($60.13) is marginally higher than with a discount ($59.28). This suggests that discounts might not significantly increase spending.
The use of promo codes does not show a significant difference in spending behavior.

7. Payment Method Preferences:
Credit Card (696 transactions) and Venmo (653 transactions) are the most preferred payment methods, indicating a trend towards digital and card-based payments.

8. Product Preferences:
The top items purchased are Blouses, Jewelry, and Pants (171 purchases each).
The preferred colors for purchases are Olive, Yellow, and Silver, suggesting these colors should be prioritized in inventory.

Conclusion:

The analysis reveals diverse customer demographics with a wide age range and a male-dominated customer base. Clothing emerges as the most popular category, and there's a balanced distribution of purchases across seasons. Spending patterns indicate moderate spending behavior, with discounts and promo codes having limited impact on increasing purchase values. The preference for digital and card-based payments is evident. Product preferences highlight specific items and colors that are most popular among customers.

Recommendations:

Focus marketing efforts on the most popular categories and top-selling items.
Tailor promotions and inventory to the preferred colors and age-specific preferences.
Enhance digital payment options considering their popularity.
Evaluate the effectiveness of discount strategies, as they do not significantly impact spending.
